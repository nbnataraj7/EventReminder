# EventReminder
This is an Event Reminder mobile application developed using Sencha Touch.

This mobile web app allows a user to add/edit a new event reminder.
Based on the date and alert time set for the event, the app categorizes the event into Past and Upcoming Events.

A New event will have fields such as people involved in it, event date, time, the time at which the user wants an alert for the event, priority of the event.
A User can then edit an Upcoming Event in order to change the category, time, activities and people involved in it.
More has to be implemented in this as still the alarm has not been implemented for the events to be notified.
